## System Architecture Overview

The Worldstore Agent is a monorepo containing two symbiotic services that create a seamless crypto-to-commerce experience:

### The Big Picture

```
User Message � XMTP Agent � AI Processing � Product Search � Order Creation � x402 Payment � Amazon Fulfillment
```

But here's what actually happens under the hood:

**XMTP Agent** (`/agent/`) - The conversational brain
- **Core**: Claude Sonnet 4 powered shopping assistant
- **Protocol**: XMTP for decentralized messaging
- **Storage**: Redis for user profiles and conversation state  
- **AI Framework**: LangGraph for complex conversation flows
- **Wallet Generation**: Deterministic wallets for gasless payments

**x402 Payment Server** (`/server/`) - The payment facilitator  
- **Protocol**: Custom x402 implementation for gasless transactions
- **Integration**: Crossmint API for Amazon order placement
- **Networks**: Multi-chain USDC support (Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum)
- **Smart Contracts**: Treasury management via Crossmint wallets

### What Makes This Special

This isn't just another crypto payment processor. Three architectural decisions make it production-ready:

1. **Gasless UX**: Users sign EIP-3009 permits instead of paying gas fees
2. **Deterministic Wallets**: No wallet setupwallets derived from XMTP identity  
3. **Natural Language**: Complex e-commerce through simple conversation

---

## Prerequisites & Environment Setup

### System Requirements

- **Node.js 20+** - The foundation everything runs on
- **pnpm 8+** - Workspace management (faster than npm/yarn)
- **Redis Stack** - User state and conversation memory
- **Git** - For deployment and version control

### Required Accounts & API Keys

You need five essential accounts before starting:

1. **Anthropic API** - For Claude Sonnet 4 AI model
2. **Crossmint Account** - For Amazon order fulfillment  
3. **SerpAPI** - For Amazon product search (optional but recommended)
4. **Redis Cloud** - Or local Redis instance
5. **Blockchain RPC Provider** - For wallet operations

### Quick Environment Check

```bash
# Verify your system is ready
node --version    # Should be 20+  
pnpm --version   # Should be 8+
redis-cli ping   # Should return PONG
```

If any of these fail, fix them before continuing. The system won't work with missing dependencies.

## Component Deep Dive

### XMTP Agent Architecture

The agent is built around a central orchestration class with specialized helpers:

**XMTPShoppingBot** - Main orchestrator
- Initializes all helper classes
- Manages XMTP client lifecycle  
- Routes messages to appropriate handlers
- Coordinates agent responses

**Key Helper Classes:**

```typescript
// Core conversation processing
ConversationProcessor  // Routes messages to correct AI agent
UserStateManager      // Tracks user context and funding requirements
ActionMenuFactory     // Creates interactive UI elements

// Wallet & Payment Operations  
WalletOperationsHandler // Manages balance checks and funding requests
OrderToolWrapper       // Wraps order placement with payment logic

// XMTP Protocol Management
XMTPClientFactory      // Handles client creation and message streaming
```

**AI Agent System:**

The system uses two specialized LangGraph agents:

1. **Shopping Agent** - Natural product search and ordering
2. **Profile Agent** - User profile management and preferences

Each agent has custom tools, prompts, and conversation flows optimized for their domain.

### x402 Payment Server Architecture

The payment server implements a custom x402 facilitator pattern:

**Core Components:**

```javascript
// Server foundation
server.js          // Express app with x402 middleware
config/index.js    // Multi-network configuration management

// Business logic
routes/orders.js   // Order creation and status endpoints  
services/crossmint.js  // Amazon order placement via Crossmint

// Supporting infrastructure
utils/logger.js    // Structured logging for debugging
```

**Payment Flow Design:**

1. **Initial Request** - Client sends order without payment
2. **402 Response** - Server returns payment requirements
3. **Payment Retry** - Client includes x402 payment header
4. **Order Fulfillment** - Server processes payment and places Amazon order

The beauty is in the orchestrationeach component handles its specialized role while maintaining the illusion of simple conversation.

---

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Clone and Setup Workspace

```bash
# Get the code
git clone <repository-url>
cd worldstore-agent

# Install dependencies for both services
pnpm install

# Verify workspace structure
ls -la
# You should see: agent/ server/ package.json pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

### Step 2: Configure the XMTP Agent

First, let's set up the conversational AI component:

```bash
cd agent
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `agent/.env` with your configuration:

```bash
# AI Configuration - Get from Anthropic Console
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Generate XMTP keys (we'll do this next)
WALLET_KEY=0x1234abcd...
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-byte-hex-encryption-key
XMTP_ENV=dev

# Backend Integration
WORLDSTORE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Product Search - Get from SerpAPI
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your-serpapi-key

# Wallet Generation - Use any Ethereum private key
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
RPC_PROVIDER_URL=https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com

# Redis - Use Redis Cloud or local instance
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

**Generate XMTP Keys:**

```bash
# Generate wallet and encryption keys
pnpm gen:keys

# This creates keys and shows you the values to add to .env
# Copy the output into your .env file
```

**Verify Agent Configuration:**

```bash
# Test the agent setup
pnpm type:check
# Should complete without errors
```

### Step 3: Configure the Payment Server

Navigate to the server directory:

```bash
cd ../server
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `server/.env` with your Crossmint configuration:

```bash
# Crossmint Configuration - Get from Crossmint Console
CROSSMINT_API_KEY=your_crossmint_api_key
CROSSMINT_ENVIRONMENT=staging
CROSSMINT_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address  
CROSSMINT_WALLET_LOCATOR=your_wallet_locator

# Order Configuration
ORDER_FEE_PERCENTAGE=0
ORDER_PAYMENT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=10

# Network Support - Customize based on your needs
CUSTOM_MIDDLEWARE_NETWORKS=ethereum-sepolia,base-sepolia,polygon-mumbai,arbitrum-sepolia
CUSTOM_MIDDLEWARE_CURRENCIES=usdc

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
DEBUG=false
```

**Verify Server Configuration:**

```bash
# Test server startup
pnpm start

# Should see:
# =� x402 + Crossmint API Server started
# =� Running on: http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 4: Start Redis (If Running Locally)

```bash
# Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
docker run -d --name worldstore-redis -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack:latest

# Option 2: Local installation
redis-server

# Test Redis connection
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

### Step 5: Launch Both Services

In your root directory:

```bash
# Start both services in development mode
pnpm dev

# This runs:
# - Agent on XMTP protocol (no HTTP port)
# - Server on http://localhost:3000
```

**Verify Everything is Running:**

```bash
# Check server health
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Should return:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:00.000Z",
#   "version": "1.0.0",
#   "environment": "development"
# }

# Check agent logs - should show:
#  XMTP Shopping Bot initialized
# =� Listening for messages...
```

Perfect! Both services are now running and ready to process orders.

## Payment Flow End-to-End

Understanding the payment flow is crucial for debugging and extending the system. Here's what happens when a user wants to buy something:

### Phase 1: Order Initiation

**User Action:** "I want to buy AirPods Pro"

```
1. User sends XMTP message
2. Agent processes with Claude AI  
3. SerpAPI searches Amazon for products
4. Agent presents options with prices
5. User confirms selection
```

**Behind the scenes:**
- Agent calls `search_product` tool with user's query
- SerpAPI returns Amazon product data (ASIN, price, reviews)
- Agent formats response with product details and order button

### Phase 2: Payment Preparation  

**User Action:** Clicks "Buy Now" button

```
1. Agent checks user profile completeness
2. Agent calls `order_product` tool
3. System generates deterministic wallet for user
4. Agent checks USDC balance across networks
5. If insufficient funds, requests funding
```

**The wallet magic:**
```typescript
// Deterministic wallet generation
const userWallet = generateUserWallet(userInboxId, masterPrivateKey);
// Same inbox ID always generates the same wallet
// No seed phrases, no wallet apps, no complexity
```

### Phase 3: x402 Payment Protocol

**Agent Action:** Places order with payment server

```
1. Agent calls x402 server: POST /api/orders (without payment)
2. Server returns 402 Payment Required with payment details
3. Agent generates EIP-3009 permit signature (gasless!)
4. Agent retries request with X-PAYMENT header
5. Server validates signature and processes payment
```

**The gasless transaction:**
```javascript
// EIP-3009 permit - user signs intent to pay, no gas required
const permit = {
  owner: userWallet.address,
  spender: treasuryWallet.address, 
  value: orderTotal,
  nonce: await getPermitNonce(userWallet.address),
  deadline: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600
};

const signature = await userWallet.signTypedData(permitDomain, permitTypes, permit);
```

### Phase 4: Order Fulfillment

**Server Action:** Processes payment and places Amazon order

```
1. Server validates EIP-3009 signature
2. Server calls Crossmint API to create Amazon order
3. Crossmint executes permit and transfers USDC to treasury
4. Crossmint places order on Amazon with user's shipping info
5. Server returns order confirmation to agent
6. Agent notifies user of successful purchase
```

### Phase 5: Order Tracking

**Ongoing:** User can check order status anytime

```
1. User asks "Where's my order?"
2. Agent calls: GET /api/orders/{orderId}/status  
3. Server queries Crossmint for latest status
4. Agent reports shipping status to user
```

**What's brilliant about this flow:**

- **No gas fees** - Users only sign permits, treasury pays gas
- **No wallet setup** - Wallets generated deterministically from XMTP identity
- **No token switching** - Works with USDC across multiple networks
- **No complexity** - User experience is just conversation

## User Experience Walkthrough

Let's follow Sarah, a crypto newcomer, through her first purchase:

### Sarah's First Message

**Sarah:** "Hey, I need wireless earbuds for working out"

**Agent Response:**
```
I found some solid workout earbuds for you! Here are the top picks:

<� AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) - $179
   - Sweat/water resistant, great noise canceling
   - 30hr battery life, secure fit
   P 4.5/5 (50K reviews)

<� Beats Fit Pro - $149  
   - Specifically designed for workouts
   - Secure-fit wingtips, 24hr battery
   P 4.4/5 (15K reviews)

Which one looks good? I can get either shipped to you.
```

**What happened behind the scenes:**
1. XMTP received Sarah's message
2. Agent classified intent as "product search"
3. Called SerpAPI with "wireless earbuds workout"
4. AI filtered results for workout-specific features
5. Formatted response with key details users care about

### Profile Setup (First-Time User)

**Sarah:** "I'll take the AirPods Pro"

**Agent Response:**
```
Great choice! The AirPods Pro are fantastic for workouts.

I'll need a few details to ship these to you:

=� Quick Setup:
" Full Name: 
" Email:
" Shipping Address:

Just tell me and I'll get your profile set up.
```

**Sarah:** "Sarah Johnson, sarah@email.com, 123 Main St, Seattle WA 98101"

**Agent Response:**
```
Perfect! Profile created 

=� Order Summary:
" AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) - $179
" Shipping: FREE
" Total: $179 USDC

Ready to complete your order?
```

**Behind the scenes:**
1. Agent detected missing profile information
2. Called `edit_profile` tool to store Sarah's details
3. Validated shipping address format
4. Prepared order with Crossmint-compatible address format

### The Payment Magic

**Sarah:** Clicks "Complete Order" button

**Agent Response:**
```
= Checking your payment options...

I found your wallet! But you need $179 USDC to complete this order.

=� Fund Your Purchase:
You can send USDC to any of these addresses:

" Ethereum: 0xabc123... (your wallet)
" Base: 0xabc123... (same wallet, Base network)
" Polygon: 0xabc123... (same wallet, Polygon network)

Once you send USDC, I'll automatically complete your order!
```

**What's happening:**
1. Agent generated Sarah's deterministic wallet
2. Checked USDC balance across all supported networks
3. Wallet is empty (first purchase), so requested funding
4. Same wallet address works on all networks (deterministic generation)

### Funding and Completion

**Sarah:** Sends $200 USDC to her wallet address on Base

**Agent Response (automatic):**
```
=� Payment received! $200 USDC detected on Base.

=� Completing your order...

 Order confirmed! 

=� Order Details:
" Order ID: CM_789abc
" AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) - $179
" Shipping: 2-3 business days  
" Tracking will be sent to sarah@email.com

Your remaining balance: $21 USDC
```

**The seamless magic:**
1. Agent detected incoming USDC transaction
2. Generated EIP-3009 permit signature (no gas fees!)
3. Called x402 server with signed payment
4. Server validated signature and called Crossmint
5. Crossmint executed permit and placed Amazon order
6. All happens in under 30 seconds

### Post-Purchase Experience

**Sarah (3 days later):** "Where's my package?"

**Agent Response:**
```
=� Your AirPods Pro order:

Status: Out for Delivery! =�
Tracking: 1Z999AA123456789
Expected: Today by 8 PM

You can track it here: [tracking link]

Need anything else?
```

**Later:**

**Sarah:** "These are amazing! Can you recommend a case?"

**Agent Response:**
```
Glad you love them! Here are some solid cases:

=� Apple MagSafe Case - $49
   - Perfect fit, wireless charging compatible
   
=� Spigen Tough Armor - $24
   - Drop protection, more budget-friendly

Want me to add one to your next order?
```

**This is the vision realized:**
- Natural conversation throughout
- No wallet complexity or gas fees
- Seamless repeat purchases
- Personalized recommendations based on history

## Production Considerations

### Security & Key Management

**Critical security practices for production deployment:**

**Environment Variable Security:**
```bash
# NEVER commit these to version control
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
WALLET_KEY=0x...
ENCRYPTION_KEY=...
CROSSMINT_API_KEY=...
```

Use proper secrets management:
- **Railway/Vercel**: Environment variables in dashboard
- **AWS**: Parameter Store or Secrets Manager  
- **Kubernetes**: Sealed secrets or external-secrets-operator

**Wallet Security:**
- Master wallet private key should be generated offline
- Use hardware security modules (HSM) for production keys
- Implement key rotation for XMTP encryption keys
- Monitor wallet balances and set up alerts

### Scalability Architecture

**Redis Scaling:**
```bash
# Production Redis setup
REDIS_URL=rediss://username:password@redis-cluster-endpoint:6380

# Enable Redis clustering for high availability
REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES=redis1:6379,redis2:6379,redis3:6379
```

**Load Balancing:**
- XMTP agent: Scale horizontally with shared Redis state
- Payment server: Stateless, can run multiple instances behind load balancer
- Redis: Use Redis Cluster or managed service (Redis Cloud, AWS ElastiCache)

**Database Considerations:**
Current system uses Redis for everything. For production scale, consider:
- PostgreSQL for order history and user profiles
- Redis for session state and conversation context
- Separate read replicas for analytics queries

### Monitoring & Observability

**Essential Metrics to Track:**

```javascript
// Business metrics
- Orders per minute
- Conversion rate (messages to orders)
- Average order value
- User retention rate

// Technical metrics  
- XMTP message processing latency
- Redis response times
- Payment server error rates
- Anthropic API latency and token usage

// Infrastructure metrics
- CPU/Memory usage across services
- Network latency between services
- Redis memory usage and hit rates
```

**Logging Strategy:**
```javascript
// Structured logging with correlation IDs
logger.info('Order processing started', {
  userInboxId: 'user123',
  orderId: 'CM_789abc',
  orderValue: 179.00,
  paymentNetwork: 'base',
  correlationId: 'req_abc123'
});
```

**Error Handling & Alerting:**
- Set up alerts for payment failures
- Monitor XMTP connection health
- Track unusual user behavior patterns
- Alert on API rate limit approaches

### Performance Optimization

**Agent Performance:**
- Implement conversation context caching
- Use connection pooling for Redis
- Batch XMTP message processing where possible
- Optimize AI prompts to reduce token usage

**Payment Server Performance:**
- Cache Crossmint order status responses
- Implement request deduplication
- Use database connection pooling
- Add response compression

**Network Optimization:**
- Deploy services in same region/VPC
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement proper caching headers
- Monitor cross-service network latency

### Compliance & Legal

**Financial Regulations:**
- Implement KYC/AML procedures for large orders
- Report suspicious transaction patterns
- Maintain audit trails for all payments
- Consider money transmission licensing requirements

**Data Privacy:**
- Implement GDPR/CCPA compliance for user data
- Encrypt user profiles and conversation history
- Provide data export and deletion capabilities
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

**Platform Policies:**
- Ensure compliance with Amazon's terms of service
- Monitor for prohibited items and categories
- Implement age verification for restricted products
- Handle returns and refunds according to platform policies

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### XMTP Agent Won't Start

**Symptom:** Agent fails to initialize with wallet errors

```bash
# Check wallet key format
node -e "console.log(process.env.WALLET_KEY.length)"
# Should be: 66 (including 0x prefix)

# Validate encryption key
node -e "console.log(process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY.length)" 
# Should be: 64 (32 bytes in hex)

# Test XMTP connection
curl -X POST https://dev.xmtp.network/health
# Should return healthy status
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Regenerate keys if invalid
pnpm gen:keys

# Copy new values to .env file
# Restart agent service
```

#### Redis Connection Failures

**Symptom:** User profiles not saving, conversation state lost

```bash
# Test Redis connectivity
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG

# Check Redis logs
redis-cli monitor
# Watch for connection attempts

# Test Redis from agent
node -e "
const Redis = require('ioredis');
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);
redis.ping().then(console.log).catch(console.error);
"
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Fix Redis URL format
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # Local
REDIS_URL=rediss://user:pass@host:port  # Remote with SSL

# Ensure Redis has enough memory
redis-cli config get maxmemory
redis-cli config set maxmemory 1gb
```

#### Payment Server 402 Errors

**Symptom:** Orders fail with "Payment Required" but no payment details

```bash
# Check Crossmint configuration
curl -H "X-API-Key: $CROSSMINT_API_KEY" \
  https://staging.crossmint.com/api/v1-alpha2/wallets/$CROSSMINT_WALLET_LOCATOR

# Should return wallet details
```

**Common Crossmint Issues:**
```bash
# Wrong environment
CROSSMINT_ENVIRONMENT=staging  # or production

# Invalid wallet locator format
CROSSMINT_WALLET_LOCATOR=email:your-email@domain.com:polygon

# Missing API permissions
# Check Crossmint dashboard for API key permissions
```

#### Claude AI Token Limits

**Symptom:** Agent responses become slow or fail with rate limits

```bash
# Monitor token usage
grep "tokens" agent/logs/*.log | tail -20

# Check API key limits
curl -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -d '{"max_tokens":1,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514"}'
```

**Solutions:**
- Upgrade Anthropic API plan for higher limits
- Implement conversation context trimming
- Cache common responses to reduce API calls
- Use shorter, more focused prompts

#### Network-Specific Payment Issues

**Symptom:** Payments work on some networks but not others

```bash
# Check USDC contract addresses
node -e "
const config = require('./server/src/config');
console.log('Ethereum Sepolia USDC:', config.x402.getContractAddress('ethereum-sepolia'));
console.log('Base Sepolia USDC:', config.x402.getContractAddress('base-sepolia'));
"

# Verify user has USDC on the correct network
# Check block explorer for contract address
```

### Debugging Techniques

**Conversation Flow Debugging:**
```bash
# Enable detailed agent logging
DEBUG_AGENT=true pnpm dev:agent

# Monitor conversation state in Redis
redis-cli get "user:conversation:USER_INBOX_ID"
```

**Payment Flow Debugging:**
```bash
# Test x402 flow manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "asin": "B0BDHWDR12",
    "email": "test@example.com", 
    "physicalAddress": {
      "name": "Test User",
      "line1": "123 Test St",
      "city": "Test City",
      "state": "CA",
      "postalCode": "90210",
      "country": "US"
    }
  }'

# Should return 402 with payment details
```

**Performance Profiling:**
```bash
# Monitor service resource usage
top -p $(pgrep -f "tsx index.ts")

# Profile Redis performance
redis-cli --latency-history -i 1

# Check XMTP message processing times
grep "message_processed" agent/logs/*.log | awk '{print $NF}' | sort -n
```
